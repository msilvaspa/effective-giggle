# Altar.io

# **I'm sad because i didnt make work the client-server communication via ws :( via postman and curl it works. because of it frontend is mocked**

---

## on backend i used two approaches ~~in case you only like/love one of them~~:
- FP on grid
- OOP on payments

---

## requirements
- nodejs v16
- keyboard :joy:
---

## runing guides

- backend:
`cd backend && npm i && npm start`

- frontend:
`cd frontend && npm i && npm start`

---
## improves roadmap:
- fix the client-server ws bug :(
- page to consume payments API (I spent a lot of time trying to fix ws bug)
- 100% test coverage on backend & frontend
- swagger
- authentication
- packaging to CI/CD
